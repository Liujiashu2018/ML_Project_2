# ML_Project_2

For this project, we use a subset of features from a famous olive oil dataset. The features I've chosen are not as predictive as the ones that I've excluded.

Features are acid measurements: palmitic, palmitol, stearic, linoleni, arachidi (you will see quite quickly that they vary somewhat in variability) These oils are classifiable into three macro-areas (variable name region): North, South, Sardinia

We have pre-split the data into: training (70%) and testing (30%). You will use the `caret` program to set tuning parameters.
